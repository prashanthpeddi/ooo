        <h5>Mannars,Shouryaangas and Ghaniyaars </h5>
        <p>In 1127, notorious dacoits from the three tribes of Mannars, Shouryaangas, and Ghaniyaars consolidated their influence over an area called Khansaar. In the year 1947 after the Indian independence, Raja Mannar's father, Siva Mannar, the chieftain of the Mannar tribe, refused Khansaar to be a part of the country and governed by the Constitution of India. He signed a pact with the Indian government that retained Khansaar's autonomy and erased its existence from the map. He segregated Khansaar into 101 provinces and appointed Kapus to head them. In the hierarchy, above the Kapus were Doras, who were feudal lords submissive to the King.</p>

        <p>Vardha, after defeating drug-addicted men dispatched by Ranga with Deva's assistance, broke out of prison and killed Ranga. Raja Mannar disclosed to Radha Rama that Bhaarava actually hailed from the Shouryaanga tribe and is one of the few people that survived the massacre of the tribe in 1985. Elsewhere, Bhaarava and an army of the surviving Shouryaanga tribesmen swore vengeance against Raja Mannar for the genocide of their tribe. Rudra joined hands with his maternal uncle, Om, for the throne. Bhaarava's captured associate, Dheru, revealed to Raja Mannar and Radha Rama that Deva is actually Devaratha Raisaar, the son of Dhaara Raisaar, who was the chief of the Shouryaanga tribe and supposed to be the next king of Khansaar in 1985. Simultaneously, Vardha addressed Deva as his Salaar, just as his loyalists learnt that he is a Shouryaanga tribesman.</p>
